```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

This report is like `test-target_markdown_default.Rmd` except it uses non-default scripts and data. Try some code chunks interactively, then render this report. Render again to see if the targets correctly skip. Make sure `_targets.R`, `_targets_r/`, and `_targets/` do not exist. Look for the scripts and data are all in the `example/` folder. Delete the HTML file and `example/` when you are done. 

# Packages

The example requires several R packages, and `targets` must be version 0.5.0.9000 or above. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "targets", "tidyr"))
```

# Setup

First, load `targets` to activate the specialized `knitr` engine for Target Markdown.

```{r}
library(targets)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tar_script = "example/script.R")
```

Near the top, you may also wish to remove the `_targets_r` directory previously written by non-interactive runs of the report.

```{r}
tar_unscript()
```

# Globals

We first define some global options/functions common to all targets. The function below plots a histogram of ozone concentrations, and our histogram target will need it.

```{targets example-globals, tar_globals = TRUE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```

# Targets

Our first target borrows the `airquality` dataset built into base R.

```{targets othername, tar_name = "raw_data", tar_simple = TRUE}
airquality
```

Our next targets preprocess the data, make a histogram, and fit a model.

```{targets downstream-targets}
list(
  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data)),
  tar_target(fit, biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data))
)
```

# Pipeline

If you ran all the `{targets}` chunks in non-interactive mode, then your R scripts are set up to run the pipeline.

```{r}
tar_make(script = "example/script.R", store = "example/store")
```

# Output

You can retrieve results from the `_targets/` data store using `tar_read()` or `tar_load()`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(biglm)
tar_read(fit, store = "example/store")
```

```{r}
tar_read(hist, store = "example/store")
```

The `targets` dependency graph helps your readers understand the steps of your pipeline at a high level.

```{r}
tar_visnetwork(script = "example/script.R", store = "example/store")
```

At this point, you can go back and run `{targets}` chunks in interactive mode without interfering with the code or data of the non-interactive pipeline.
