\arguments{
\item{seconds}{Numeric of length 1,
default number of seconds between refreshes of the graph.
Can be changed in the app controls.}

\item{seconds_min}{Numeric of length 1, lower bound of \code{seconds}
in the app controls.}

\item{seconds_max}{Numeric of length 1, upper bound of \code{seconds}
in the app controls.}

\item{seconds_step}{Numeric of length 1, step size of \code{seconds}
in the app controls.}

\item{targets_only}{Logical, whether to restrict the output to just targets
(\code{FALSE}) or to also include global functions and objects.}

\item{exclude}{Character vector of nodes to omit from the graph.}

\item{outdated}{Logical, whether to show colors to distinguish outdated
targets from up-to-date targets. (Global functions and objects
still show these colors.) Looking for outdated targets
takes a lot of time for large pipelines with lots of branches,
and setting \code{outdated} to \code{FALSE} is a nice way to speed up the graph
if you only want to see dependency relationships and pipeline progress.}

\item{label}{Label argument to \code{\link[=tar_visnetwork]{tar_visnetwork()}}.}

\item{level_separation}{Numeric of length 1,
\code{levelSeparation} argument of \code{visNetwork::visHierarchicalLayout()}.
Controls the distance between hierarchical levels.
Consider changing the value if the aspect ratio of the graph
is far from 1. If \code{level_separation} is \code{NULL},
the \code{levelSeparation} argument of \code{visHierarchicalLayout()}
defaults to \code{150}.}

\item{degree_from}{Integer of length 1. When you click on a node,
the graph highlights a neighborhood of that node. \code{degree_from}
controls the number of edges the neighborhood extends upstream.}

\item{degree_to}{Integer of length 1. When you click on a node,
the graph highlights a neighborhood of that node. \code{degree_to}
controls the number of edges the neighborhood extends downstream.}

\item{config}{Character of length 1, file path of the YAML
configuration file with \code{targets} project settings.
The \code{config} argument specifies which YAML configuration
file that \code{tar_config_get()} reads from or \code{tar_config_set()}
writes to in a single function call.
It does not globally change which configuration file is used
in subsequent function calls. The default file path of the YAML
file is always \verb{_targets.yaml} unless you set another
default path using the \code{TAR_CONFIG} environment variable,
e.g. \code{Sys.setenv(TAR_CONFIG = "custom.yaml")}. This also has the
effect of temporarily modifying the default arguments to other functions
such as \code{\link[=tar_make]{tar_make()}} because the default arguments
to those functions are controlled by \code{tar_config_get()}.}

\item{project}{Character of length 1, name of the current
\code{targets} project. Thanks to the \code{config} R package,
\code{targets} YAML configuration files can store multiple
sets of configuration settings, with each set corresponding
to its own project. The \code{project} argument allows you to
set or get a configuration setting for a specific project
for a given call to \code{tar_config_set()} or \code{tar_config_get()}.
The default project is always called \code{"main"}
unless you set another
default project using the \code{TAR_PROJECT} environment variable,
e.g. \code{Sys.setenv(tar_project = "custom")}. This also has the
effect of temporarily modifying the default arguments to other functions
such as \code{\link[=tar_make]{tar_make()}} because the default arguments
to those functions are controlled by \code{tar_config_get()}.}

\item{height}{Character of length 1,
height of the \code{visNetwork} widget and branches table.}

\item{display}{Character of length 1, which display to show first.}

\item{displays}{Character vector of choices for the display.
Elements can be any of
\code{"graph"}, \code{"summary"}, \code{"branches"}, or \code{"about"}.}

\item{background}{Logical, whether to run the app in a background process
so you can still use the R console while the app is running.}

\item{browse}{Whether to open the app in a browser when the app is ready.
Only relevant if \code{background} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{host}{Character of length 1, IPv4 address to listen on.
Only relevant if \code{background} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{port}{Positive integer of length 1, TCP port to listen on.
Only relevant if \code{background} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{whether to print a spinner and informative messages.
Only relevant if \code{background} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{supervise}{Whether to register the process with a supervisor. If \code{TRUE},
the supervisor will ensure that the process is killed when the R process
exits.}

\item{poll_connection}{Whether to have a control connection to
the process. This is used to transmit messages from the subprocess
to the main process.}

\item{stdout}{The name of the file the standard output of
the child R process will be written to.
If the child process runs with the \code{--slave} option (the default),
then the commands are not echoed and will not be shown
in the standard output. Also note that you need to call \code{print()}
explicitly to show the output of the command(s).
IF \code{NULL} (the default), then standard output is not returned, but
it is recorded and included in the error object if an error happens.}

\item{stderr}{The name of the file the standard error of
the child R process will be written to.
In particular \code{message()} sends output to the standard
error. If nothing was sent to the standard error, then this file
will be empty. This argument can be the same file as \code{stdout},
in which case they will be correctly interleaved. If this is the
string \code{"2>&1"}, then standard error is redirected to standard output.
IF \code{NULL} (the default), then standard output is not returned, but
it is recorded and included in the error object if an error happens.}
}
\value{
A handle to \code{callr::r_bg()} background process running the app.
}
\description{
Launches a background process with a Shiny app
that calls \code{\link[=tar_visnetwork]{tar_visnetwork()}} every few seconds.
To embed this app in other apps, use the Shiny module
in \code{\link[=tar_watch_ui]{tar_watch_ui()}} and \code{\link[=tar_watch_server]{tar_watch_server()}}.
}
\details{
The controls of the app are in the left panel.
The \code{seconds} control is the number of seconds between
refreshes of the graph, and the other settings match
the arguments of \code{\link[=tar_visnetwork]{tar_visnetwork()}}.
