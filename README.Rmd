Pipeline tools coordinate the pieces of computationally demanding analysis projects. The `targets` package is a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science in R. The package skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, orchestrates the necessary computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstracts files as R objects. If all the current output matches the current upstream code and data, then the whole pipeline is up to date, and the results are more trustworthy than otherwise.

## Philosophy

A pipeline is a computational workflow that does statistics, analytics, or data science. Examples include forecasting customer behavior, simulating a clinical trial, and detecting differential expression from genomics data. A pipeline contains tasks to prepare datasets, run models, and summarize results for a business deliverable or research paper. The methods behind these tasks are user-defined R functions that live in R scripts, ideally in a folder called `"R/"` in the project. The tasks themselves are called "targets", and they run the functions and return R objects. The `targets` package orchestrates the targets and stores the output objects to make your pipeline efficient, painless, and reproducible.

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), covered in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
1. [Data science workflow management techniques](https://rstats.wtf/index.html).
1. [How to write functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) to prepare data, analyze data, and summarize results in a data analysis project.

## Installation

If you are using `targets` [with `crew` for distributed computing](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html), it is recommended to use `crew` version `0.4.0` or higher.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("crew")
```

There are multiple ways to install the `targets` package itself, and both the latest release and the development version are available.

Type | Source | Command
---|---|---
Release | CRAN | `install.packages("targets")`
Development | GitHub | `pak::pkg_install("ropensci/targets")`
Development | rOpenSci | `install.packages("targets", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")`

## Get started in 4 minutes

The 4-minute video at <https://vimeo.com/700982360> demonstrates the example pipeline used in the [walkthrough](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) and [functions](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html) chapters of the [user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/). Visit <https://github.com/wlandau/targets-four-minutes> for the code and <https://rstudio.cloud/project/3946303> to try out the code in a browser (no download or installation required).

## Usage

To create a pipeline of your own:

1. [Write R functions](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html) for a pipeline and save them to R scripts (ideally in the `"R/"` folder of your project).
1. Call [`use_targets()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/use_targets.html) to write key files, including the vital `_targets.R` file which configures and defines the pipeline.
1. Follow the comments in `_targets.R` to fill in the details of your specific pipeline.
1. Check the pipeline with [`tar_visnetwork()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_visnetwork.html), run it with [`tar_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make.html), and read output with [`tar_read()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_read.html). [More functions](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/index.html) are available.
