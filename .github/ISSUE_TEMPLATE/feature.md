## Prework

* [ ] I understand and agree to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/wlandau/targets/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/wlandau/targets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [ ] New features take time and effort to create, and they take even more effort to maintain. So if the purpose of the feature is to resolve a struggle you are encountering personally, please consider first posting a "trouble" or "other" issue so we can discuss your use case and search for existing solutions first.
* [ ] Please format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

## Proposal

Please describe the new feature. If applicable, write a minimal example in R code or pseudo-code to show input, usage, and desired output.

To help us read any code you include (optional) please try to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The `style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.
