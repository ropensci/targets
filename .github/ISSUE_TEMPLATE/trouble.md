To help us read your code, please try to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The `style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.

## Desired result

What output or behavior do you want to see? Please be as specific as you can.
