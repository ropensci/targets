## Prework

* [ ] Read and agree to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/wlandau/targets/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/wlandau/targets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [ ] Post a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) so the maintainer can troubleshoot the problems you identify. A reproducible example is:
    1. [ ] **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.
    1. [ ] **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.
    1. [ ] **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
